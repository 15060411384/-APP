introduction:
介绍：
In the era we live in, many people have become "moonlight clan" (people who spend all their monthly earnings), and many are accustomed to indulging themselves. Many people long for spiritual pursuits, yet they are addicted to some repetitive things that bring momentary pleasure.  
在我们所处的这个时代,很多人成为了月光族,很多人习惯了放纵。很多人渴望精神追求,却沉迷于一些重复的带来一时之爽的东西。
Precisely because of this, perhaps we need some long-term sustenance to help us recognize ourselves, and to help us, or rather enable us to take control of some things that are within our grasp.  
正因如此,或许我们需要一些长期的寄托来帮助我们认清自己,帮助我们或者说我们支配一些我们可以掌握的东西。
After all, the older we get, the fewer things we will find that are within our control.
毕竟,越长大,会发现自己可以掌控的东西越少。
Therefore, the accounting app "Let's Start Keeping Accounts" came into being. 
所以记账APP [就开始记账吧] 应运而生。
This APP is not simply a record of income and expenditure. Instead, it is an attempt with artificial algorithms and what we jokingly call "artificial unintelligence" (artificial intelligence).
该APP并非简单对于支入,支出的记录.而是一次与人工算法和人工智障(人工智能)的尝试。

What this project hopes to achieve is:
该项目希望能够做到的是：
1. Every choice you make is meaningful. 
1. 你的选择都有意义
Some people hope to accumulate wealth in advance for a certain future investment. For example, I hope to buy clothes/sneakers of a certain brand, so I want to accumulate enough funds before that. This project hopes to provide you with real-time positioning of the price fluctuations of a certain brand on the Internet. And based on your real-time expenditure situation, it will offer you reasonable consumption suggestions.
Some people hope to strengthen their willpower. Just as the old Chinese saying goes, "When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will, exhausts his muscles and bones, and starves his body and肤 (Here, '肤' is a bit out of place in this modern context, but keeping it as per the original). This project hopes to make you more determined in your willpower through questioning and praise.
Some people want to be like "hoarding mice" and clearly see that the very act of accumulation itself is meaningful. This project will serve as your partner during the process of accumulation and accompany you all the time.
Some people don't know what they want to do. However, once you choose this product, it means that you want to change something. It's just that in the past, you might have "tried" to make a change, but you gave yourself the illusion that you couldn't change. So you just went with the flow. This project hopes to understand you by analyzing you and, from the perspective of an onlooker, help you recognize yourself.
Some people hope to have control over their spending. This project hopes to provide you with relatively clear data analysis. 
有人希望为未来的某一个确定投资提前积累财富，比如，我希望买某一品牌的衣服/球鞋，于是我想在这个之前积累足够的资金。
该项目希望为你实时的定位当前网络上对于某一品牌的价格波动。并根据你实时的支出情况，为你提供合理的消费建议。
有人希望锻炼意志，如中国古话“天将降大任于斯人也，必先苦其心志，劳其筋骨，饿其体肤”
该项目希望通过质问与赞美，使你能够更加坚定自己的意志。
有人希望做个屯屯鼠，能够清楚的看到积累本身就是意义。
该项目将作为你积累时的伙伴,一直陪伴
有人不知道自己希望做什么,但你一旦选择了该产品,就意味着你想改变什么,只不过过去你可能“尝试”过改变,但给了你自己无法改变自己的错觉。于是随波逐流。
该项目希望通过分析，使我们明白你，用旁观者的角度使你认知到自己
有人希望掌控着自己的开销
